# CartPole-tinygrad

This project implements a Q-Learning reinforcement learning algorithm using the tinygrad framework. The agent is trained to solve the CartPole-v1 environment from Gymnasium (formerly OpenAI Gym).

## Q-Learning 
Q-learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that trains an agent to assign values to its possible actions based on its current state, without requiring a model of the environment (model-free).(1)

## Gymnasium
 A classic benchmark used in reinforcement learning (RL) to illustrate and test RL algorithms. It simulates a simple physics-based control problem.(2)
